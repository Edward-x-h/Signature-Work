This study investigates the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying financial decision-making under probabilistic ambiguity using EEG and eye-tracking data. By analyzing EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) and event-related potentials (ERP), the research examines how individuals allocate cognitive resources and process uncertainty. To uncover meaningful patterns, Correlated Component Analysis is applied to assess relationships between EEG features, and t-SNE Visualization is utilized to reveal decision-making states, such as risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior. Additionally, EEG signals are incorporated within the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to infer hidden cognitive states, providing insights into decision load, attention, and emotional regulation. The study also integrates eye-tracking data to explore visual attention patterns during decision-making, further linking neural activity to behavioral outcomes. This approach offers a comprehensive model for understanding how neural dynamics influence decisions under ambiguity, with implications for optimizing decision strategies in uncertain financial contexts. The findings aim to contribute to the development of neuroadaptive systems and personalized decision-support tools in finance and beyond.
